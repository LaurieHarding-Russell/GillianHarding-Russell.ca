        <h2>Nothing prepared me for Winter</h2>
        <pre>
The trees yielding their bare arms up to the sky
with a turning to something like prayer

twig mark footprints
by the side of the garage from a passing, small bird
looking for seed, and stories of snow

Nothing prepared me for winter
though the geese had been talking 
all through October among the golden leaves

by the slate grey lake that mirrors the sky 
where in a V of purpose everything 

should have prepared me
for winter the trees themselves 
had been talking about all summer long

late into October barely a breeze
though the air was brisk enough when sunny 
some days

the deer mice tunnelling through 
some crumbling orifice inside the thick, brick walls,
the chaos of cupboards and the musk of fear
their gnawing at night
inside my bones.

And driving over the highway overpass
that saws the curve of the land in two square parts
to my right a farmer’s field where a fox cuts across

the trail catches a scent of someone walking
slides off into the sedge grass where the ice 
just thick enough to pass over

undetected to the other
side, and I in my old white car 
have reached the turn off

never noticing the light that is always red, turning  
green with a pause that turns to prayer
as I linger too long, a thought

about the stillness of trees  
in the chill morning light the car behind 
me, slamming across black ice into the trunk of my car-
My skeleton trembling with something like a turning to prayer.

Nothing prepared me for the violence 
of winter 
the wrenched bird neck of accident
of the unforeseen ahead

when you are a bird who cannot find seed
when you are a mouse in the dead of winter
inside the frozen ground 

with a fifty percent chance of survival
when you are a fox who can or cannot 
cross over the ice
    to the other side, the wrinkles
of worry, the cracks overwriting our lives

and the means of your death already written 
in the skeins of the wind wrapping arms around you 
at the turn of the road 

although you had been told
and believed the world was always green
or golden 

had only heard stories of snow
told by the wind that blows 
sideways

drifts and piles high
inside yourself and the land.

        <h2>Voice Print Omega</h2>
        <pre>


You dragged the answering machine
thick in dust and time 
out of the basement, between 
the boxes of old clothes and yellowing papers, set it up
for us who didn’t know how to

(never comfortable with such machines)
in the kitchen between the microwave and the fridge.
This is how you use, you said, just fourteen years old
and knowledgeable, unreeling miles

or aeons of tape back
to when it belonged to Gram.
A time machine into the past with an uncle’s New Year’s greeting
for the coming year that happened a decade ago, and your cousin
Angela talking to a girlfriend about a boy named Preston

whom no one remembers now.
Should we erase these voices? you asked,
from the past, and I knew from the shadow in your voice
you had felt it too.
A ghost’s blessing and the other a shiver of
déjà vu

I think I may remember Preston now.

Flowers have Feetflex

(old proverb: a birth means
a death in the house)

I tread lightly over flowers;
their roots, bodies writhe
under my feet. Don't look down:  
The dead may rise

if you press the flowers’ faces
into the earth.  My son won't sleep;
can't tell me what’s wrong.
Supermom to find out.

My daughter wants me
to lie with her. She has
a bad dream. “You can't
have a bad dream until 

you fall asleep,” I say.  I who dream
with open eyes, peripheral
leaning into whites of eyes

to thoughts growing thick 
as weeds or flowers.  The parts 
of today the puzzle

to solve. “I'll lie down with you
when your brother falls
asleep”; but you, too, have fallen

Where?  Asleep.  Middle-of-the-night 
purple slats across teaspoon faces.
Silver moonlight, guilt the knife
promises I fail to keep – evil-shaped
sparks, across the dark.
June heat on the brain:  Help!
The spoon’s running away
from the fork.

The forked one, me.  My daughter
screaming herself to wake.
I come, Supermom.

Mummy the whale, pregnant
carrying more cargo.  I take 
too much room.  “Feel 
the baby inside, darling.”

Maybe the teddy bears are company after all.  
Then my son reaches arms
pale into the dark, to me
the solid root, 
he trusts is still there.

Carry him back to bed.
At the bedroom door, his sister, 
“I changed my mind, please sleep
with me.”  But she must sleep

on a quilt, an island to herself
soft on the hardwood floor
beside her brother's bed, among shadows
shifting, lightening.  Me, the boulder
solid between.

Waking up to a dream.
Seven-month fetus
a wild compass
in my belly.

Stop that noise!

Walking downstairs
to bacon sizzling into the night.
No one to tend it.  Stomach acid
splashing yellow,
a red fist.

That noise!  that noise!  in the basement just below
the brainstem.  My husband 
"tiring the kids out."

Will this Nutcracker dream
never wind down, the dolls not stop
dancing, the teddy bears and ponies never 
stop prancing?

Stop!

Pan-like my husband plays the trumpet
on his back, face purple above brows. 
Lips red worms.

T.V. blares. 
No one’s watching it.
Ghosts flutter the greenish screen.

Stop, stop world!

Birds' sleepy twitter.
False dawn, shadows sink, 
and it is morning.

Hello, world!

The sun shines through 
my head, the world of transparencies
sifting through.  I phone 

my mother, ask how Dad's doing.  
His remaining leg 
purple as raw meat.

Live spirits under 
the ground:  Leave the flowers 
where they are.
