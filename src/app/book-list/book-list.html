      description="
Nature in its beauty and dynamism is a fragile system that could be lost to us – though it will continue in
some form without us. ‘Uninterrupted’ nature was once our home and identity, one that we looked to for
meaning and solace, a world larger than ourselves – but lately we seem to have forgotten our place in the
cosmos.
<br><br>
These poems of warning evoke terror in recognition of what could be our future. Yet they are
written out of love for what could be lost and they search for what may be wrong in ourselves.
These poems of gillian harding-russell reward the reader with panoramic images of the natural/unnatural
world. Her description is almost visionary in its exactness, with questions (challenging, incisive, puzzled,
unanswerable) valid as ways to begin and sometimes end. We ache with her awareness of what she has
“always done, rushing here and now there / along well-oiled ruts, a fellow flash of teeth / reaching into
my heart when all I want / is a logical, an easier, way out.” Yet her desire for hope manages to carry the
poems beyond the idea of our evident destruction of the planet, and her irony and humour personalize
(and universalize) the sometimes sad depictions of us and Earth. And let&#39;s not forget the love of foxes,
just one example of the intimacy gillian&#39;s poems create with the earth and its creatures, including
ourselves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~David Zieroth, author of <cite>the bridge from day to night</cite> (Harbour Publishing) <br>
<br>
Coming during this time of great upheaval when thinkers and leaders are digging deep for hope,
<cite>Uninterrupted</cite> grips the shoulders and turns us to face with new eyes matters of agency and industry.
Elegant and muscular at every turn, these erudite poems sweep through time, winging our present reality
with flights of history and myth, stretching perspective and shifting vantage points. I thought I’d long ago
bridged the gulf between me and the natural world, but thanks to this book I now know I have a ways to
go. These brilliant poems will help me get there.
<br>

<br>
How to think about the natural world and what we are doing to it? The impressions nature makes upon the
senses and the soul are reawakened in the suddenness of gillian harding-russell’s language. Mountains
and prairies, flora and fauna, burst across the page, wonderful and awesome. However, humankind is
fouling the nest, and the author makes us see and feel the desecration. Yet, beyond the telling of
Anthropocene heedlessness and loss, she gives us fresh angles from which to view what we are doing.
These poems can change one’s perspective and offer insight into what we may hope will continue
“uninterrupted.”<br>

  <h2>Widdershins</h2>

<pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">The earth shimmies on its axis
and rotates around the sun, and most
of us are blown clockwise</p>

<p class="stanza">in the wind of its orbit heading to the right
from the sharpest-nosed vole in the field
to the darkest green crab under the ocean</p>

<p class="stanza">favouring a dexter forefoot or dominant
right claw over a sinister and smaller left limb.
There is instinct for direction, knowing</p>

<p class="stanza">your right hand from your wrong, and your strong
from your weak, to keep you secure
against accident, though some of us prefer</p>

<p class="stanza">the traction of moving
against earth’s windy passage. I know an ambidexter
who can hold a blue pointer on a leash with his right</p>

<p class="stanza">and make a call on a cell to his loved one
on the left, and all
while riding a skateboard widdershins…</p>

  <h2>Yellow bird and black</h2>
  <pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">Through an arc of hot blossomy wind
in June, a yellow bird high
in the flowering pink tree
breathing outside my bedroom window</p>

<p class="stanza">tilted his head and hopped up and
down, his round eye on me as if
to say, ‘How strange this wingless creature!’
through glass at this high altitude
between brain hemispheres.</p>

<p class="stanza">Past noon, down the summer road
a man on his arid patch in an angry shove
swivelled the hose from dying grass to
rusted evergreen, which made me look up
at what he was dousing with his ill humour
for its being black and saying caw</p>

<p class="stanza">and all that. And I reflexed, ‘Don’t
do that! You’ll hurt the bird!’ The crow
flying to the north, shadowed
side of the house-high tree, sable feathers drenched
so he could hardly fly as the man pursued
with water pressure’s punishing fire –
I was afraid of the man’s anger</p>

<p class="stanza">so left him to the black one (I’m sorry to say)
but hoped in my dreams the bird would remember
the man (as a corvus will) and come out some night
when he was taking out his garbage to peck out
his eyes in his innermost nightmare.</p>

<p class="stanza">I mean, wasn’t the crow able? His satin feathers sleek
and strong? But the man was large, his arms boastfully
tattooed in self-pride. Swarthy and sleek and native
to these parts, couldn’t a crow jack o’spades
just fly away? But the man firmly believed
the black bird was evil, and I dared not</p>

<p class="stanza">look back. Next day a flattened replica
of the bird on the pavement, its beak’s raw cry of injustice
embroidered bloodily on that pavement
heard through silent corners of the day, though
I tried in my mind to hold onto the yellow bird’s song
so winsome and sunny out my second-storey window
to brighten the crow shadows falling so jaggedly
around my inability to sleep.</p>

<h2>Raven at -40</h2>

<pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">high on a street lamp
fans shadow wings
to draw the ghost of sun</p>

<p class="stanza">on the black of his back
setting the light sensor off.
What a nifty trick</p>

<p class="stanza">(as a simple wit)
to get the device lit
and as a measure for
pleasure’s warmth
in the shade of the grey
ice midday.</p>

<h2>Up Tin Can Hill</h2>
<pre>

<p class="stanza">Nothing like A. Y. Jackson’s painting
with wild ochres and greens and magenta
the meadow lies before us and is frosted in snow.
Rat Lake, that doesn’t have rats, but
instead muskrats, deceives. The brushy tails
with fluffy spores might be rat tails</p>

<p class="stanza">or horsetails according to the guidebook.
Horsetails that once grew tall as trees
chomped by immense lumbering creatures
between glacial ages that pushed
the rocks at angles to ourselves.</p>

<p class="stanza">At the height of the promontory that juts
over Great Slave, an icy wind
burns our faces in March, and I am
aware of the drop, avert
my eyes from vertigo
to a human contraption
to the right of where we stand
with claptrap dangling
plastic and metal parts
built for what purpose? Creaking
in the sharp wind
that frosts our voices</p>

<p class="stanza">and this wonder, like the obsolete
mining apparatus, rusted and antique,
discarded between the twiggy trees
might one day be considered
trace human fossils – ichnotaxa.</p>

<p class="stanza">On the white expanse of lake below us, skidoo tracks
smudge a fox’s neat footprints
and a ptarmigan’s zippered walk
along the shoreline between rocks.
I imagine I hear a skidoo’s
animal-like screech and huffing start
between thoughts.</p>

<p class="stanza">Going back down the trail, a raven weaves
dark words and you tell me there were wolverines
in this vicinity a few winters ago. Why am I both excited
that they once coloured the trail with danger and
relieved they are no longer likely to be seen?
I mean to be seen at all
around here?</p>

    title="I Forgot To Tell You"

    description="In <cite>I forgot to tell you</cite>, fears and inhibitions in familiar settings but presented in a new light rear their homely, sad heads. This collection “confronts contemporary disasters of the world and of the soul with the edge of language.” (David Zieroth).

    Bill Robertson compares the themes in <cite>I forgot to tell</cite> you to those in Irving Layton’s suburbia: whereas Layton talks from outside the experience with its “imposed civility,” gillian harding-russell “speaks from inside those checkerboards, both with anxiety, and with love for the curves that defy convention.”">
    <h2>Nothing prepared me for Winter</h2>
    <pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">The trees yielding their bare arms up to the sky
with a turning to something like prayer</p>

<p class="stanza">twig mark footprints
by the side of the garage from a passing, small bird
looking for seed, and stories of snow</p>

<p class="stanza">Nothing prepared me for winter
though the geese had been talking
all through October among the golden leaves</p>

<p class="stanza">by the slate grey lake that mirrors the sky
where in a V of purpose everything</p>

<p class="stanza">should have prepared me
for winter the trees themselves
had been talking about all summer long</p>

<p class="stanza">late into October barely a breeze
though the air was brisk enough when sunny
some days</p>

<p class="stanza">the deer mice tunnelling through
some crumbling orifice inside the thick, brick walls,
the chaos of cupboards and the musk of fear
their gnawing at night
inside my bones.</p>

<p class="stanza">And driving over the highway overpass
that saws the curve of the land in two square parts
to my right a farmer’s field where a fox cuts across</p>

<p class="stanza">the trail catches a scent of someone walking
slides off into the sedge grass where the ice
just thick enough to pass over</p>

<p class="stanza">undetected to the other
side, and I in my old white car
have reached the turn off</p>

<p class="stanza">never noticing the light that is always red, turning
green with a pause that turns to prayer
as I linger too long, a thought</p>

<p class="stanza">about the stillness of trees
in the chill morning light the car behind
me, slamming across black ice into the trunk of my car-
My skeleton trembling with something like a turning to prayer.</p>

<p class="stanza">Nothing prepared me for the violence
of winter
the wrenched bird neck of accident
of the unforeseen ahead</p>

<p class="stanza">when you are a bird who cannot find seed
when you are a mouse in the dead of winter
inside the frozen ground</p>

<p class="stanza">with a fifty percent chance of survival
when you are a fox who can or cannot
cross over the ice
to the other side, the wrinkles
of worry, the cracks overwriting our lives</p>

<p class="stanza">and the means of your death already written
in the skeins of the wind wrapping arms around you
at the turn of the road</p>

<p class="stanza">although you had been told
and believed the world was always green
or golden</p>

<p class="stanza">had only heard stories of snow
told by the wind that blows
sideways</p>

<p class="stanza">drifts and piles high
inside yourself and the land.</p>

    <h2>Voice Print Omega</h2>
    <pre class="poem">


<p class="stanza">You dragged the answering machine
thick in dust and time
out of the basement, between
the boxes of old clothes and yellowing papers, set it up
for us who didn’t know how to</p>

<p class="stanza">(never comfortable with such machines)
in the kitchen between the microwave and the fridge.
This is how you use, you said, just fourteen years old
and knowledgeable, unreeling miles</p>

<p class="stanza">or aeons of tape back
to when it belonged to Gram.
A time machine into the past with an uncle’s New Year’s greeting
for the coming year that happened a decade ago, and your cousin
Angela talking to a girlfriend about a boy named Preston</p>

<p class="stanza">whom no one remembers now.
Should we erase these voices? you asked,
from the past, and I knew from the shadow in your voice
you had felt it too.
A ghost’s blessing and the other a shiver of
déjà vu</p>

<p class="stanza">I think I may remember Preston now.</p>

    title="Candles In My Head"
    description="In <cite>Candles in my head</cite>, the ‘candles’ of insight are both funereal and celebratory marking a death and a birth in the house. I wrote these poems to make sense of the death of my father and to celebrate the birth of my son born two days before what would have been my father’s birthday.">
    <pre class="poem">
<h2>Flowers have Feet</h2>

<p class="stanza">(old proverb: a birth means
a death in the house)</p>

<p class="stanza">I tread lightly over flowers;
their roots, bodies writhe
under my feet. Don't look down:
The dead may rise</p>

<p class="stanza">if you press the flowers’ faces
into the earth.  My son won't sleep;
can't tell me what’s wrong.
Supermom to find out.</p>

<p class="stanza">My daughter wants me
to lie with her. She has
a bad dream. “You can't
have a bad dream until</p>

<p class="stanza">you fall asleep,” I say.  I who dream
with open eyes, peripheral
leaning into whites of eyes</p>

<p class="stanza">to thoughts growing thick
as weeds or flowers.  The parts
of today the puzzle</p>

<p class="stanza">to solve. “I'll lie down with you
when your brother falls
asleep”; but you, too, have fallen</p>

<p class="stanza">Where?  Asleep.  Middle-of-the-night
purple slats across teaspoon faces.
Silver moonlight, guilt the knife
promises I fail to keep – evil-shaped
sparks, across the dark.
June heat on the brain:  Help!
The spoon’s running away
from the fork.</p>

<p class="stanza">The forked one, me.  My daughter
screaming herself to wake.
I come, Supermom.</p>

<p class="stanza">Mummy the whale, pregnant
carrying more cargo.  I take
too much room.  “Feel
the baby inside, darling.”</p>

<p class="stanza">Maybe the teddy bears are company after all.
Then my son reaches arms
pale into the dark, to me
the solid root,
he trusts is still there.</p>

<p class="stanza">Carry him back to bed.
At the bedroom door, his sister,
“I changed my mind, please sleep
with me.”  But she must sleep</p>

<p class="stanza">on a quilt, an island to herself
soft on the hardwood floor
beside her brother's bed, among shadows
shifting, lightening.  Me, the boulder
solid between.</p>

<p class="stanza">Waking up to a dream.
Seven-month fetus
a wild compass
in my belly.</p>

<p class="stanza">Stop that noise!</p>

<p class="stanza">Walking downstairs
to bacon sizzling into the night.
No one to tend it.  Stomach acid
splashing yellow,
a red fist.</p>

<p class="stanza">That noise!  that noise!  in the basement just below
the brainstem.  My husband
"tiring the kids out."</p>

<p class="stanza">Will this Nutcracker dream
never wind down, the dolls not stop
dancing, the teddy bears and ponies never
stop prancing?</p>

<p class="stanza">Stop!</p>

<p class="stanza">Pan-like my husband plays the trumpet
on his back, face purple above brows.
Lips red worms.</p>

<p class="stanza">T.V. blares.
No one’s watching it.
Ghosts flutter the greenish screen.</p>

<p class="stanza">Stop, stop world!</p>

<p class="stanza">Birds' sleepy twitter.
False dawn, shadows sink,
and it is morning.</p>

<p class="stanza">Hello, world!</p>

<p class="stanza">The sun shines through
my head, the world of transparencies
sifting through.  I phone</p>

<p class="stanza">my mother, ask how Dad's doing.
His remaining leg
purple as raw meat.</p>

<p class="stanza">Live spirits under
the ground:  Leave the flowers
where they are.</p>
