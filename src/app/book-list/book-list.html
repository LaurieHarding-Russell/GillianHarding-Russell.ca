<h2>Raven at -40</h2>

<pre>
high on a street lamp
fans shadow wings 
to draw the ghost of sun

on the black of his back
setting the light sensor off.
What a nifty trick

(as a simple wit)
to get the device lit
and as a measure for
pleasure’s warmth
in the shade of the grey
ice midday.

<h2>Up Tin Can Hill</h2>
<pre>


Nothing like A. Y. Jackson’s painting 
with wild ochres and greens and magenta
the meadow lies before us and is frosted in snow. 
Rat Lake, that doesn’t have rats, but 
instead muskrats, deceives. The brushy tails 
with fluffy spores might be rat tails 

or horsetails according to the guidebook. 
Horsetails that once grew tall as trees 
chomped by immense lumbering creatures
between glacial ages that pushed 
the rocks at angles to ourselves.

At the height of the promontory that juts
over Great Slave, an icy wind
burns our faces in March, and I am
aware of the drop, avert
my eyes from vertigo
to a human contraption
to the right of where we stand
with claptrap dangling 
plastic and metal parts	
built for what purpose? Creaking 
in the sharp wind
that frosts our voices

and this wonder, like the obsolete 
mining apparatus, rusted and antique, 
discarded between the twiggy trees
might one day be considered 
trace human fossils – ichnotaxa.

On the white expanse of lake below us, skidoo tracks
smudge a fox’s neat footprints
and a ptarmigan’s zippered walk
along the shoreline between rocks.
I imagine I hear a skidoo’s
animal-like screech and huffing start
between thoughts.

Going back down the trail, a raven weaves
dark words and you tell me there were wolverines 
in this vicinity a few winters ago. Why am I both excited    
that they once coloured the trail with danger and
relieved they are no longer likely to be seen?
I mean to be seen at all
around here?

    title="I Forgot To Tell You"
    credit="Cover Design by Jackie Forrie" publish="Thistledown Press, 2007"
    description="In <i>I forgot to tell you</i>, fears and inhibitions in familiar settings but presented in a new light rear their homely, sad heads. This collection “confronts contemporary disasters of the world and of the soul with the edge of language.” (David Zieroth).

    Bill Robertson compares the themes in <i>I forgot to tell</i> you to those in Irving Layton’s suburbia: whereas Layton talks from outside the experience with its “imposed civility,” gillian harding-russell “speaks from inside those checkerboards, both with anxiety, and with love for the curves that defy convention.”">
    <h2>Nothing prepared me for Winter</h2>
    <pre>
The trees yielding their bare arms up to the sky
with a turning to something like prayer

twig mark footprints
by the side of the garage from a passing, small bird
looking for seed, and stories of snow

Nothing prepared me for winter
though the geese had been talking 
all through October among the golden leaves

by the slate grey lake that mirrors the sky 
where in a V of purpose everything 

should have prepared me
for winter the trees themselves 
had been talking about all summer long

late into October barely a breeze
though the air was brisk enough when sunny 
some days

the deer mice tunnelling through 
some crumbling orifice inside the thick, brick walls,
the chaos of cupboards and the musk of fear
their gnawing at night
inside my bones.

And driving over the highway overpass
that saws the curve of the land in two square parts
to my right a farmer’s field where a fox cuts across

the trail catches a scent of someone walking
slides off into the sedge grass where the ice 
just thick enough to pass over

undetected to the other
side, and I in my old white car 
have reached the turn off

never noticing the light that is always red, turning  
green with a pause that turns to prayer
as I linger too long, a thought

about the stillness of trees  
in the chill morning light the car behind 
me, slamming across black ice into the trunk of my car-
My skeleton trembling with something like a turning to prayer.

Nothing prepared me for the violence 
of winter 
the wrenched bird neck of accident
of the unforeseen ahead

when you are a bird who cannot find seed
when you are a mouse in the dead of winter
inside the frozen ground 

with a fifty percent chance of survival
when you are a fox who can or cannot 
cross over the ice
to the other side, the wrinkles
of worry, the cracks overwriting our lives

and the means of your death already written 
in the skeins of the wind wrapping arms around you 
at the turn of the road 

although you had been told
and believed the world was always green
or golden 

had only heard stories of snow
told by the wind that blows 
sideways

drifts and piles high
inside yourself and the land.

    <h2>Voice Print Omega</h2>
    <pre>


You dragged the answering machine
thick in dust and time 
out of the basement, between 
the boxes of old clothes and yellowing papers, set it up
for us who didn’t know how to

(never comfortable with such machines)
in the kitchen between the microwave and the fridge.
This is how you use, you said, just fourteen years old
and knowledgeable, unreeling miles

or aeons of tape back
to when it belonged to Gram.
A time machine into the past with an uncle’s New Year’s greeting
for the coming year that happened a decade ago, and your cousin
Angela talking to a girlfriend about a boy named Preston

whom no one remembers now.
Should we erase these voices? you asked,
from the past, and I knew from the shadow in your voice
you had felt it too.
A ghost’s blessing and the other a shiver of
déjà vu

I think I may remember Preston now.

    title="Candles In My Head"
    description="In <i>Candles in my head</i>, the ‘candles’ of insight are both funereal and celebratory marking a death and a birth in the house. I wrote these poems to make sense of the death of my father and to celebrate the birth of my son born two days before what would have been my father’s birthday.">

<h2>Flowers have Feet</h2>

(old proverb: a birth means
a death in the house)

I tread lightly over flowers;
their roots, bodies writhe
under my feet. Don't look down:  
The dead may rise

if you press the flowers’ faces
into the earth.  My son won't sleep;
can't tell me what’s wrong.
Supermom to find out.

My daughter wants me
to lie with her. She has
a bad dream. “You can't
have a bad dream until 

you fall asleep,” I say.  I who dream
with open eyes, peripheral
leaning into whites of eyes

to thoughts growing thick 
as weeds or flowers.  The parts 
of today the puzzle

to solve. “I'll lie down with you
when your brother falls
asleep”; but you, too, have fallen

Where?  Asleep.  Middle-of-the-night 
purple slats across teaspoon faces.
Silver moonlight, guilt the knife
promises I fail to keep – evil-shaped
sparks, across the dark.
June heat on the brain:  Help!
The spoon’s running away
from the fork.

The forked one, me.  My daughter
screaming herself to wake.
I come, Supermom.

Mummy the whale, pregnant
carrying more cargo.  I take 
too much room.  “Feel 
the baby inside, darling.”

Maybe the teddy bears are company after all.  
Then my son reaches arms
pale into the dark, to me
the solid root, 
he trusts is still there.

Carry him back to bed.
At the bedroom door, his sister, 
“I changed my mind, please sleep
with me.”  But she must sleep

on a quilt, an island to herself
soft on the hardwood floor
beside her brother's bed, among shadows
shifting, lightening.  Me, the boulder
solid between.

Waking up to a dream.
Seven-month fetus
a wild compass
in my belly.

Stop that noise!

Walking downstairs
to bacon sizzling into the night.
No one to tend it.  Stomach acid
splashing yellow,
a red fist.

That noise!  that noise!  in the basement just below
the brainstem.  My husband 
"tiring the kids out."

Will this Nutcracker dream
never wind down, the dolls not stop
dancing, the teddy bears and ponies never 
stop prancing?

Stop!

Pan-like my husband plays the trumpet
on his back, face purple above brows. 
Lips red worms.

T.V. blares. 
No one’s watching it.
Ghosts flutter the greenish screen.

Stop, stop world!

Birds' sleepy twitter.
False dawn, shadows sink, 
and it is morning.

Hello, world!

The sun shines through 
my head, the world of transparencies
sifting through.  I phone 

my mother, ask how Dad's doing.  
His remaining leg 
purple as raw meat.

Live spirits under 
the ground:  Leave the flowers 
where they are.
