    <h2>A crow, raggedly, driven off course</h2>
    <pre>    
fighting the wind that broke the forearm of a poplar
(smaller birds holding onto elbow twigs in green lace
of cedar where they sipped the warmer air, the mauve 
of their dreams for brighter weather), and so as we walked 
around the dusky lake I noted the geese on the bank, their heads 
turned pragmatically into their feather backs close to the ground 

riding the present turning into whatever would be…
the tumult of our conversation against the unpredictable wind
became a struggle, a word awry, mine or yours – I cannot remember
who started it – catapulting like a dislodged twig 	that hit you

accidentally in the face, and I discovered we were each 
listening to our own mind’s thoughts set on their course by what 
had come before to make us what we were, and so we arrived 
sadly at the car, damaged by the mad direction 
the eddy our conversation had taken in the wind.
