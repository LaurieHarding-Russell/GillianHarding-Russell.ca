    <h2>A crow, raggedly, driven off course</h2>
    <pre>    
...fighting the wind that broke the forearm of a poplar
(smaller birds holding onto elbow twigs in green lace
of cedar where they sipped the warmer air, the mauve 
of their dreams for brighter weather), and so as we walked 
around the dusky lake I noted the geese on the bank, their heads 
turned pragmatically into their feather backs close to the ground 

riding the present turning into whatever would be…
the tumult of our conversation against the unpredictable wind
became a struggle, a word awry, mine or yours – I cannot remember
who started it – catapulting like a dislodged twig 	that hit you

accidentally in the face, and I discovered we were each 
listening to our own mind’s thoughts set on their course by what 
had come before to make us what we were, and so we arrived 
sadly at the car, damaged by the mad direction 
the eddy our conversation had taken in the wind.

    <h2> Coming Soon!</h2>

    <book image="/assets/InAnotherAir.jpg" credit="Cover Art by Wendy Winter." publish="Radiant Press, 2018" 
    description="<i>In Another Air</i> is a collection of poems about the north that I wrote after visiting my daughter in Yellowknife over a period of four years. By the title, I suggest a world removed from our own ‘in another latitude’ or ‘historical time frame’ or ‘aeon.’ Here the sense of a reality removed from our own may also be captured by the metaphor of a musical air. From poems about Franklin’s second expedition down the Coppermine River (inspired by the main drag in Yellowknife being called “Franklin’s Ave”) to modern day Yellowknife with a Diamond Centre and to a larger north with a complex archaeological past, the poems attempt to capture a kaleidoscopic vision of a changing north.">
        <h2>Raven at -40</h2>

<pre>
high on a street lamp
fans shadow wings 
to draw the ghost of sun

on the black of his back
setting the light sensor off.
What a nifty trick

(as a simple wit)
to get the device lit
and as a measure for
pleasure’s warmth
in the shade of the grey
ice midday.

<h2>Up Tin Can Hill</h2>
<pre>
        

Nothing like A. Y. Jackson’s painting 
with wild ochres and greens and magenta
the meadow lies before us and is frosted in snow. 
Rat Lake, that doesn’t have rats, but 
instead muskrats, deceives. The brushy tails 
with fluffy spores might be rat tails 

or horsetails according to the guidebook. 
Horsetails that once grew tall as trees 
chomped by immense lumbering creatures
between glacial ages that pushed 
the rocks at angles to ourselves.

At the height of the promontory that juts
over Great Slave, an icy wind
burns our faces in March, and I am
aware of the drop, avert
my eyes from vertigo
to a human contraption
to the right of where we stand
with claptrap dangling 
plastic and metal parts	
built for what purpose? Creaking 
in the sharp wind
that frosts our voices

and this wonder, like the obsolete 
mining apparatus, rusted and antique, 
discarded between the twiggy trees
might one day be considered 
trace human fossils – ichnotaxa.

On the white expanse of lake below us, skidoo tracks
smudge a fox’s neat footprints
and a ptarmigan’s zippered walk
along the shoreline between rocks.
I imagine I hear a skidoo’s
animal-like screech and huffing start
between thoughts.

Going back down the trail, a raven weaves
dark words and you tell me there were wolverines 
in this vicinity a few winters ago. Why am I both excited    
that they once coloured the trail with danger and
relieved they are no longer likely to be seen?
I mean to be seen at all
around here?
