I look forward to the release of the anthology to raise money for Ukraine by Qantara Press (as
yet untitled). There have been several hurdles but it should be coming out soon, and I am proud to have
two poems included, “When you come across a Snag,” and “Ducks are back.”

The poem “Green Soul” appears in this lovely prairie nature blog.

<h2 class="poem-header">Solus</h2>
<pre>
What would all the beauty
in the world mean to me
if I were the last and only,
none to share its joy?

As I walked through the steepled
and tasselled grasses alive with cricket
voice and a grasshopper bopped

into my knee, a pair of citron butterflies
waltzing low over the dewy sunrise, pastel
and mottled peach in the east, I turned to

you beside me. Look! I said, but remembered
you were away on a trip and I was left alone with
the field’s crazed symphony under the sky.

As I stood on the slant of asphalt driveway
to slide the garbage onto the street, a gash of persimmon
from forest fires in the western wedge of sky

above the houses, and the sun was a pomegranate eye
frightening beauty in its awfulness and
threat, I turned to you again

to lessen its terrible spell
on my tightening chest, and was relieved
you were once more standing there.

                                                              Just think, if we alone stood
                                                              without a wild heartbeat and
                                                              no wilderness left

                                                              the earth denuded of its natural
                                                              inhabitants would we feel

                                                              rightful citizens of a planet
                                                              so bereft?

“Visitations in this state” comes from the chapbook, <i>Megrim</i> (The Alfred Gustav Press, 2021)
The word “megrim” descends etymologically from the Greek, ‘half and skull’ and refers to migraine.

<h2>Visitations in this state</h2>
<pre>
may include a flaring rainbow
arcing with pulsating lights
out the side of eyes

from looking too narrowly
too strenuously ahead

or behind. Or a demon’s presence
may be detected during a fade-out
of the ordinary light

when all the colours of the world
are drained and the day becomes
the negative of a chill dream.

Or, say, when a guardian angel guiding
you along the path set out by the ordinary day
suddenly deserts you.

Sometimes this happens at an intersection
on a busy road, traffic flying through,
red lights in your head

or walking into a public building under fluorescence
when you are a bug in a box with open flaps
waiting in a long line and feel

you must apologize to the salesperson
for some incompetence – when panic sets in
and a blanking out of the lurid white room

and an angel-turning-demon stirs a whirlwind
tearing up whole pieces of your mind –
patches of the salesperson’s tired face rearranging

themselves like a Picasso painting, triangle of nose
between plastic glasses and slab
of furrowed forehead, hovering uncannily

disappearing –
tabula rasa emerging in moth-eaten muddle
as you fumble with a faceless card

impossible to read its Formicidae digits when
a citizen-in-a hurry offers dubious help ‘would you
like assistance...’ as you rush out of the way

a rat remembering the passage
out of a labyrinth, the heavy-swinging, pressurized door
that breathes a cold lungful of crystal flying motes

a flurry of angry or insouciant angels
sharp sprinkling icy cinders on your March-pale neck
zipping up your winter parka.

From <i>Megrim</i> (The Alfred Gustav Press, 2021).

  “Lady Slippers” was posted on the Manitou Poetry Trail during the Wonder of Words festival (WOW),
  July 29-30 weekend. Thank you to David Schliech.

<h2>Lady Slippers</h2>
<pre>
They dug them up from a ditch outside Nelle’s
farm – a bulldozer bulldozing this way…
and all the lady slippers’ yellow toes pointing through
the green blades of leaves…
      Look, a small opening for a lady
      to put her foot into the slipper!
though something like a lady’s boot, high-heeled and hinged
to the crepe-maroon sepal of a sock on the green stem…
so Nelle said let’s hurry while the city fellow eats his lunch

and they dumped the ladies in a bucket, two buckets they filled
put them in the boot of Alannah’s red Kia and transported them – Nelle
eighty-nine and moving to a senior’s home could take two, she thought
      for a window box, and the other bucket of
      yellow-shod ladies brought to our house, transplanted
under the eaves and picture window for us to gaze down
as on a woody forest floor and marvel

where they bloomed again the next year! but now I worry
about the future of my ladies when I’m gone. What about
the next real estate purchaser? I see someone from the future
stepping on their yellow satin toes
      unaware of the beauty beneath his fast-walking
      ahead with what profits and profitability
on the horizon. Tear it down… who cares what’s beneath
our convenience.

So who will take care of my ladies? Make sure they’re safe?
      Their beauty in dark-earth-places a sunny joy
      that surprises…surely enough reason to be?
My lady slippers didn’t ask to be born into a cemented
world with no time and place for green and
a dance of yellow slippers, when metal
and pavement build up
and around…

So I worry about my children
      with their modern and artificial-world woes
      amongst the crowded and lonely, with none
for the soul under a fairy green architecture
of leaves to guide them home to love.
