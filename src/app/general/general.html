My review on <i>The Essential Elizabeth Brewster</i>, selected by Ingrid Ruthig (The Porcupine Quill,
2021) will appear in <i>The Fiddlehead</i> in the spring of 2022. Dr. Brewster was my thesis
supervisor at the University of Saskatchewan, and so I am grateful to Ingrid Ruthig for this
selected work (with her fine introduction) in Elizabeth’s honour.

Also, an article “Iconic Mythopoeia in MacEwen’s <i>T.E. Lawrence Poems</i>” that was part of my
Ph.D. thesis, titled <i>Open Forms of Mythopoeia</i>, was republished in the spring of 2021 in
<i>Literature Criticism</i>, a library reference series (Gale/Cengage Learning) I am pleased to add.

Here is a recent poem from my manuscript-in-progress <i>Reinventions of the Material Self</i>.
“Releasing a flight of birds” was first published in <i>The Antigonish Review</i> and was profiled this
year on the League of Canadian Poets’ Poetry.

<h2 class="poem-header">Releasing a flight of birds</h2>
<pre>
When the doorbell rang at eight o’clock
my mother taking breakfast dishes to the sink
told me to answer it but I did not know
what to do standing at the open door
with sunlight streaming in
on this small man in straw hat
and sunglasses, frail and looking off

towards the dogwood blossoms
unfurling new scent-sparking licks
over the cement steps, when I noticed
he held a cane precisely, like a staff
beside his right foot, my mother calling
over her shoulder, was that

the piano-tuner? to let him in, she said
coming forward with damp dishtowel in hand
to lead him into the living room, telling
this quiet man the treble keys had
lost the sparkle in their tiny
voices and the bass was grating low
flat, middle C a little hollow

while the piano-tuner nodded
very slightly behind dark glasses, said
something and looked ahead where his eyes
were unseen stars. For three hours he sat at the piano
stool and pressed keys with soft

deliberate touch, his fingers long and well-formed
probing a tender nuance and crescendo, the top of the piano
propped open to the living room air
as now and again he stood up, stepped behind

the raised oak lid to watch a small hammer
on felt pad strike a copper string vibrating singly and
then two or three strings together twanging, finally chords
humming and strumming loud throughout the house
when my mother asked, would he like a cup

of coffee it had just been brewed, he did not hear, and she
not wanting to interrupt, simply watched him
from the bottom of the stairs, sitting down
on the last step as he improvised a flock of wild notes
that soared through the house’s air seeking liberty from the white blank
of silence and un-sight.

“Widdershins” was posted in a birdhouse-like structure designed by Darrel Baschuk at the
Community Centre at Manitou Beach during the month of November 2021, and was also
  published in an electronic local newsletter <i>Manitou Matters</i>. Several of these poetry posts are
situated around that town, and are changed monthly. Thank you to David Schliech for so
kindly showcasing our work!

<h2>Widdershins</h2>
<pre>
The earth shimmies on its axis
and rotates round the sun, and most
of us are blown clockwise

in the wind of its orbit heading to the right
from the sharpest-nosed vole in the field
to the darkest green crab under the ocean

favouring a dexter forefoot or dominant
right claw over a sinister and smaller left limb.
There is instinct for direction, knowing

your right hand from your wrong, and your strong
from your weak, to keep you secure
against accident, though some of us may prefer

the traction of moving
against earth’s windy passage. I know an ambidexter
who can hold a blue pointer on a leash with his right

and make a call on his cell to his loved one
on the left, and all
while riding a skateboard widdershins…

<h2>Megrim</h2>

In the Spring of 2021, a chapbook/holm <i>Megrim</i> was published by Alfred Gustov Press.

<p>
  The word “megrim” comes from the Greek, half a head and refers to migraine.
  The sequence explores the experience of migraine as well as its historical and spiritual roots.
