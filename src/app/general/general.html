I am delighted to announce my new poetry collection <cite>Lift the Ear of a Nautilus</cite> will be published in time
for poetry month, April 2026. Many thanks to Turnstone Press and staff.

Below is a brief description:

      Elegiac and lyrical, <cite>Lift the Ear of a Nautilus</cite> marks one poet’s friendship with another who died
      from cancer. The poems move through my first meeting with Lisa at The Moose Jaw Festival of
      Words, through memories of her personality, her love of mules and her experience with cancer
      that she shared intimately through emails and telephone calls – also sending life treasures in
      books and broken seashells before her death. The shells “broken” because she did not want to
      deny a creature a home/body to live inside. Lisa particularly identified with an angel-wing
      bivalve (like a pair of angel wings!) pecked by a seabird, that was included in the treasures she
      sent me.

      In the closing movement of <cite>Nautilus</cite>, the poems shift focus to her husband Dale with a theme that
      life goes on after death. In “Journeys do not end,” “Dear Life,” Dale carries out a shared wish
      with Lisa to go sailing on the east coast, and he does so with her spirit keeping him strong during
      a difficult but redemptive journey. His wish to sight a whale and then discovering a seal in
      “Whale tales,” and “As it turned out,” open up subtle implications of reincarnation. Also in the
      title poem, the nautilus with its spiral architecture and many chambers (with convoluted access)
      suggests the shape of the universe and a broader understanding of life and death as coexistent
      states and on a continuum. Although elegiac, <cite>Lift the Ear of a Nautilus</cite> is also celebratory.

<b>A poem from upcoming <cite>Lift the Ear of a Nautilus</cite>:</b>

<h2 class="poem-header ml-8">Goose down, lichen green</h2>
<pre class="poem ml-8">
<p class="stanza">When I put on your winter coat
Lisa, I was, I admit
a little afraid</p>
<p class="stanza">                  I might be invading
another soul’s space – but
the coat fit like they say a glove
shoulder right, length too
then with a feeling of warmth
in a cloud of softness
I heard your voice, dear friend
and felt welcome remembering
some of the things you said.</p>

Also, I am pleased to announce that I have a micro-chapbook (holm) <cite>A Handle on Things</cite> (The Alfred
Gustav Press) that will be published during the summer of 2026. Five poems will be included: “There is a
suitcase for overthinking,” “There is a cupboard for postponement,” “There is a door for misfortune,” and
“Sometimes you cannot get.”

1. A poem about our black lab who has been diagnosed with epilepsy (from an unpublished manuscript-in-
progress <cite>Domestic (dome/dis) disorder</cite> )

<h2 class="poem-header">There is a smell after terror</h2>
<pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">When the dog woke
in the black of
night with a jolt,
skittered on curled
tense toenails across
the room and back, dropped
to the floor – lightning struck
by what meteor of dream,
mind-neurons as stars
seized in a personal apocalypse
of frothing jaw, iron-clamped
over colliding feet that covered
galaxies on his Sirius side</p>

<p class="stanza">and there was a rank sweet
scent, poignant and distinct
after the electric and shock
even as saliva and slime
permeated my hands and hair
we laved the exhausted dog
with soothing wet flannel, his
great dog heart still punching
to escape his body, an alien
elixir lifting into the air</p>

<p class="stanza">in a chemical language
I had just one letter for
from an alphabet
of my own <i>megrim</i>
with their electrifying fireworks
instant dread and high alarm
though I could not yet comprehend
what word in what language
that single shared character
might be part of…</p>

2. Two poems from the unpublished manuscript <cite>Learning to see in the dark.</cite>

<h2 class="poem-header">How all the wars start</h2>
<pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">A thunder of iridescent black wings
alongside the grey-fringed, sapphire-lit
a noisy squall of brass calls
and all this battle scene under the new day
uncovered by black of night, a watery
egg of sun a pendulum in first, low swing –
how did it all start? What its grievance?</p>

<p class="stanza">There was a chill overnight and hardship in the air,
nature’s storehouse depleting…
the lengthening black night and frost-furred
morning, and all the insects heading under
the leaves. I glanced at the bloody archduke
lying on the high road but walked on…
What else could I do?</p>

<p class="stanza">Three mornings ago, you see, a small animal
with white fur underparts exposed run over
on the high road, too big for a jackrabbit
entitled to roam in search of songbirds
when inside the house a bowl of milk awaits
like a second moon after the night’s sport
On the path next day, three crows and a magpie
feasted alongside in an irritable peace during
hard economic times…</p>

<p class="stanza">On the third morning walking by the same road,
this collateral: a black knight with shiny shield
of wing poking up, not yet flattened by a too-fast
accelerating car in the hungry-eating, distracted cold
and a magpie in full sapphire-wing regalia landed on
the fallen black one to feast; but wouldn’t a crow’s
crime against a fallen magpie be the same?</p>

<p class="stanza">So the war had begun: black-winged missile
after black-winged missile
                        launched with fearsome beaks</p>

<p class="stanza">at the opportunist trailing long-tailed glory
while a black squadron formed a strategic triangle
to drive back the opposing army, more magpies regrouping
in retaliation, the corvid injured, not dead…
or was it the breeze that stirred a filigreed feather?
While saddened by the blood and flesh ruin, wasn’t I</p>

<p class="stanza">heartened by a solidarity among crows as they defended
their friend? …now a funeral dirge sounding for a kilometre
around their fallen one…</p>

<h2 class="poem-header">An underwater root for aggression</h2>
<pre class="poem">
<p class="stanza">The orca hit by a fishing boat
knew pain that lingered,
an open sore on her flank, that
weeping, would not let her sleep
for weeks, so traumatized was she
in a delirium of dream so that</p>

<p class="stanza">she came to fear all such apparitions
sailing into her sullied turquoise waters off
the coast of Gibraltar (though she had
a different name for the place in clicks</p>

<p class="stanza">and beeps). Another trawler coming fast-fast
round the strait – the fishing boat
with heavy net dragging the ocean’s floor
at an industrious clip…attacked by</p>

<p class="stanza">two slippery grey bodies in the waters, battering
the structure with gigantic force so that the rudder
collapsed and the leaking vessel had to be
hauled, slumped on a rope by the jutting prow
to the shore. A fishing boat never before attacked
by a fish in living memory so it was surmised</p>

<p class="stanza">the injured mother orca influenced her pod
on how to exert the most force with powerful tails,
and we see how a being with a brain the size
of an auditorium though also reputed wise may be
inclined to seek a mean path of calculated</p>

<p class="stanza">destruction when attackers push in… and they so
nonchalant in their ways, injuring those natural
inhabitants who rightfully came before them…</p>
