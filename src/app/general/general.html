    <h2>A crow, raggedly, driven off course</h2>
    <pre>    
fighting the wind that broke the forearm of a poplar
(smaller birds holding onto elbow twigs in green lace
of cedar where they sipped the warmer air, the mauve 
of their dreams for brighter weather), and so as we walked 
around the dusky lake I noted the geese on the bank, their heads 
turned pragmatically into their feather backs close to the ground 

riding the present turning into whatever would be…
the tumult of our conversation against the unpredictable wind
became a struggle, a word awry, mine or yours – I cannot remember
who started it – catapulting like a dislodged twig 	that hit you

accidentally in the face, and I discovered we were each 
listening to our own mind’s thoughts set on their course by what 
had come before to make us what we were, and so we arrived 
sadly at the car, damaged by the mad direction 
the eddy our conversation had taken in the wind.

    <book image="/assets/InAnotherAir.jpg" credit="Cover Art by Wendy Winter." publish="Radiant Press, 2018" 
    description="In Another Air is a collection of poems about the north that I wrote after visiting my daughter in Yellowknife over a period of four years. By the title, I suggest a world removed from our own ‘in another latitude’ or ‘historical time frame’ or ‘aeon.’ Here the sense of a reality removed from our own may also be captured by the metaphor of a musical air. From poems about Franklin’s second expedition down the Coppermine River (inspired by the main drag in Yellowknife being called “Franklin’s Ave”) to modern day Yellowknife with a Diamond Centre and to a larger north with a complex archaeological past, the poems attempt to capture a kaleidoscopic vision of a changing north.">
        <h2>Raven at -40</h2>

<pre>
high on a street lamp
fans shadow wings 
to draw the ghost of sun

on the black of his back
setting the light sensor off.
What a nifty trick

(as a simple wit)
to get the device lit
and as a measure for
pleasure’s warmth
in the shade of the grey
ice midday.

        <h2>Off track between Frame Lake and Back Bay</h2>

<pre>
When you go off
the trodden track into 
the tamarack woods
do not look down holes
wrapped around with 
a blanket of snow
or a coyote might rise
from a white bank
under your nose.

When you go off
the cross-country ski track
remember trees in a population
of trees all look the same
to our not-tree race
but do not underestimate 
their landmarks
and misdirections.
Go this way, or that 
way, for trees might indeed
be an early draft for yourself.
(Look how that stunted one
twists away from the wind
or towards his friend
or fellows. Or against
that slanted rock or company
of white-legged birches.)

If you go off the snowshoe track
to take a picture
of that raven watching you
he may dive down 
to high-five you,
dash a greasy wing
in your face – 

If you go off
the skidoo trail around Frame Lake
you might come across a crowd
of black eyes in the snow, only
noticing they are ptarmigan
as they walk away from you
on furry-feather white toes as if
you are rude to intrude
on their cathedral space

and so you may have learned
that it is wise to become a tree
to enter the world of the shy ones:
that white hare thinks he is invisible 
in snow, and the fox red-shadows 
him, pointed nose aware of you both
inhabiting the air. Don’t mention

the recluses, snowy owl blinking
in the white half-light, while
a moose might step out of the gap-toothed 
trees chewing bark sideways
glancing at you, curious 
about humanity (if it is not rutting 
season, moose are sensible 
enough), but beware

if you are desperate, far
from anywhere and have to take 
a pee under that tallish skinny tree
sheltered by granite outcrop
on the way to the ice caves
because a chipmunk with striped
undernourished winter tail
might scream at you and hurl husks 
from January’s in-the-dark suppers
on your unsuspecting head,
your camera out of reach
and his small fury retreating.
