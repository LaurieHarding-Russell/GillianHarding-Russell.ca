I am delighted to have two poems coming up in <i>The Queen’s Quarterly</i> (spring, 2024):
‘How All The Wars Start’ and ‘An Underwater Root for Aggression.’

Thank you to Hollay Ghadery, our poet laureate, for inviting me to respond to a question about
<i>In Another Air</i> for the River Street Writing blog. An interview:

I am also pleased to have had three poems accepted for the League of Canadian Poet’s
<i>Poetry // Pause</i> during the last year. The poems include one from my recent poetry
collection <i>Uninterrupted</i>, “Ourobouros,”:

<h2 class="poem-header">Ourobouros</h2>
<pre>
A puce underbelly of smog coiled ’round the City
stickying the low cement
                        and high-flung metal surfaces
dirt-speckled, tall coppery windows of tempered glass
rising sullen and toothy on the skyline
frozen in time and weathers, harmlessly there
each day, when a citizen cocked his head
at a magenta cumulonimbus wound around
the leaning heads of skyscrapers…
The sky was toppling!

Everybody had heard that panic-attack story
and so, annoyed at the alarmist, someone said, ‘Take
an orange or a blue pill,’ and turned back to what
she’d been doing, a fug of fear, it’s true, smothering
lucid thought – it had been an opaque cold
spring – continuing in this defensive

frame doing what they were used to
to accumulate happiness against gusty bad
unpredictable weather, in digits
registered on plastic and stored
on liquid crystal screens made most
cleverly of arsenic and lead

their vehicles outside double-weather doors
billowing in a sooty puff of exhaust on the parking lot
under a broad building with the long bronze eyes
where they navigated in the half-light of half-
care, working every day, eight ‘til four
waiting for the Friday off, when briefly
the news: The planet has warmed by three degrees
and the ice caps in the forest-fire carboniferous sunset
are melting like tiger ice cream…

‘Sensationalist!’ a person beside me at work
remarked, ‘obviously wrong-headed’ since yesterday
they’d announced a hole in the sky supposed
to have been patched up. Melting like ice cream
and this the coldest spring on record?

Here it was July, a lopsided
ophidian cloud spitting ice pellets, and as I looked
out the window, a brown animal sliminess slithered by
in a squelching way though it might have been
the sudden movement of my eyes
glancing back at it.

      Also, thanks to <i>Grain</i> magazine for publishing the poem “Reading before My Peppery
      and Earthy Friends” last spring, 2023.

<h2 class="poem-header">Reading before my Peppery and Earthy friends</h2>
<pre>
Nasturtiums I’ve secretly seeded
in a lighted back bedroom in the dark
of the house during the gloom of winter
and the drear of a world’s disease
are sprouting leggy seedlings
well ahead of spring. A Nordic
window affords enough light

to give these headstrong ones life:
the nasturtium nymphs-to-be
with springy palms of round leaves
dancing on slender childlike stems
doing a pas-de-chat with articulate style
and stigma and anther while dreaming
their gold- and orange- and red-drenched
silken-petal souls into being.

Beside them in the long white plantar
I planted red chilis already flickering
a row of green tongues on black topsoil.
I suspect the nasturtiums turn their heads
(one arched-nostril flower-visage-to-be a speck
of yellow bud) to argue with the hot-tempered chilis
so when I come to them with my thoughts

unguarded, I have to be careful
or I might be challenged
but when I stand before their nodding heads
to read a poem they tend to listen – well, if
it interests them, though a slur or skipped
word they pick up instantly.

Yes, those pepperish capo friends and
hot disposed relatives with capuchin views
are harshest critics and may take issue
with something I never thought about
so I’ve found myself staring embarrassedly
at a round-faced leaf’s WHA-AT?

and so when I thought all was clear as day
I must find another way to say it
But then the chilis, seeing my distress titter
under their still-green-leaf, hottish breath.

“Visitations in this state” comes from the chapbook, <i>Megrim</i> (The Alfred Gustav Press, 2021)
The word “megrim” descends etymologically from the Greek, ‘half and skull’ and refers to migraine.

<h2 class="poem-header">Visitations in this state</h2>
<pre>
may include a flaring rainbow
arcing with pulsating lights
out the side of eyes

from looking too narrowly
too strenuously ahead

or behind. Or a demon’s presence
may be detected during a fade-out
of the ordinary light

when all the colours of the world
are drained and the day becomes
the negative of a chill dream.

Or, say, when a guardian angel guiding
you along the path set out by the ordinary day
suddenly deserts you.

Sometimes this happens at an intersection
on a busy road, traffic flying through,
red lights in your head

or walking into a public building under fluorescence
when you are a bug in a box with open flaps
waiting in a long line and feel

you must apologize to the salesperson
for some incompetence – when panic sets in
and a blanking out of the lurid white room

and an angel-turning-demon stirs a whirlwind
tearing up whole pieces of your mind –
patches of the salesperson’s tired face rearranging

themselves like a Picasso painting, triangle of nose
between plastic glasses and slab
of furrowed forehead, hovering uncannily

disappearing –
tabula rasa emerging in moth-eaten muddle
as you fumble with a faceless card

impossible to read its Formicidae digits when
a citizen-in-a hurry offers dubious help ‘would you
like assistance...’ as you rush out of the way

a rat remembering the passage
out of a labyrinth, the heavy-swinging, pressurized door
that breathes a cold lungful of crystal flying motes

a flurry of angry or insouciant angels
sharp sprinkling icy cinders on your March-pale neck
zipping up your winter parka.

From <i>Megrim</i> (The Alfred Gustav Press, 2021).

      The poem “The Kindness of Roses” was posted on the Poetry Nature Trail at the
      Manitou Wonder of Words (WOW) Festival in the summer of 2023.

<h2 class="poem-header">The kindness of roses</h2>
<pre>
I lean to sniff the roses on the curve
along the path, their pink scent
so poignant sweet and delicate
I feel kind to all kind

and creatures too… a jackrabbit
dozes in the shade of a skimpy tree
and over there a city worker, neon-
vested, clad from hard hat to leather
boots with terrifying – at first, to me
– red breathing-mask, drills holes
along our sidewalk, that cloud
of cement dust all around him!

31℃ and I leave out a bowl
of water for the jack, and would offer
lemonade to the worker, his water-bottle
probably hot and stale – as he approaches

our rosebush… So, to be kind to one’s kind,
must one have experienced the rose, its living
sweetness? a scent for which there are no words,
crown of gold dust and a bee nestled in – felt its joy?
