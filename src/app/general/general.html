<h2>Green soul</h2>
<pre>
Although there are several possibilities, 
I could not be sure 
of the bird’s name in the bird book
(not written by birds, and me 
no expert) not to mention the bird’s name
in the bird’s own tongue we could not repeat 
for the shape and chisel of sounds 

in their language so unlike our own. 
I have heard a bird laugh and one full of praise 
for the sun and another one’s voice afraid
warning me (or the crow) to stay away 
from her nest, and another with a cry so piercing 
quiet (I could not let it out of my head) about the spirit 
of her species brought low by humans into a gold mine
situation on earth where they’d lived longer than we 
had, before the last ice age with their dinosaur cousins.

You moved to pick the green fellow up on the edge 
of a shovel (afraid to snap a frightened wing in capturing
her in cupped hands – the bird could have been ‘him,’ the
green quite vivid) but he mercifully flit to the branch above
and so I think the green soul was merely tired out

after navigating over cities and skyscrapers
confusing lights and changed terrain (a creek 
with reeds dug up, now a muddy canal) resting 
between flights on his arduous journey to the south. 
Or maybe he ate some seed brittle with glitter
of some fungicide, all that was left 
in the combined field. Although
there are several possibilities
we could not be too sure…

A sleek green body light as a feather, 
hollow-boned
but pulsing spirited with small sad peepers,
half shut and giving up, I feared
as I peered down at her.

Nature in its beauty and dynamism is a fragile system that could be lost to us – though it will continue in
some form without us. ‘Uninterrupted’ nature was once our home and identity, one that we looked to for
meaning and solace, a world larger than ourselves – but lately we seem to have forgotten our place in the
cosmos. 
<br><br>
These poems of warning evoke terror in recognition of what could be our future. Yet they are
written out of love for what could be lost and they search for what may be wrong in ourselves.
These poems of gillian harding-russell reward the reader with panoramic images of the natural/unnatural
world. Her description is almost visionary in its exactness, with questions (challenging, incisive, puzzled,
unanswerable) valid as ways to begin and sometimes end. We ache with her awareness of what she has
“always done, rushing here and now there / along well-oiled ruts, a fellow flash of teeth / reaching into
my heart when all I want / is a logical, an easier, way out.” Yet her desire for hope manages to carry the
poems beyond the idea of our evident destruction of the planet, and her irony and humour personalize
(and universalize) the sometimes sad depictions of us and Earth. And let&#39;s not forget the love of foxes,
just one example of the intimacy gillian&#39;s poems create with the earth and its creatures, including
ourselves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~David Zieroth, <i>the bridge from day to night</i> (Harbour Publishing) <br>
<br>
Coming during this time of great upheaval when thinkers and leaders are digging deep for hope,
<i>Uninterrupted</i> grips the shoulders and turns us to face with new eyes matters of agency and industry.
Elegant and muscular at every turn, these erudite poems sweep through time, winging our present reality
with flights of history and myth, stretching perspective and shifting vantage points. I thought I’d long ago
bridged the gulf between me and the natural world, but thanks to this book I now know I have a ways to
go. These brilliant poems will help me get there.

How to think about the natural world and what we are doing to it? The impressions nature makes upon the
senses and the soul are reawakened in the suddenness of gillian harding-russell’s language. Mountains
and prairies, flora and fauna, burst across the page, wonderful and awesome. However, humankind is
fouling the nest, and the author makes us see and feel the desecration. Yet, beyond the telling of
Anthropocene heedlessness and loss, she gives us fresh angles from which to view what we are doing.
These poems can change one’s perspective and offer insight into what we may hope will continue
“uninterrupted.”<br>

<h2>Widdershins</h2>

<pre>
The earth shimmies on its axis
and rotates around the sun, and most
of us are blown clockwise

in the wind of its orbit heading to the right
from the sharpest-nosed vole in the field
to the darkest green crab under the ocean

favouring a dexter forefoot or dominant
right claw over a sinister and smaller left limb.
There is instinct for direction, knowing

your right hand from your wrong, and your strong
from your weak, to keep you secure
against accident, though some of us prefer

the traction of moving
against earth’s windy passage. I know an ambidexter
who can hold a blue pointer on a leash with his right

and make a call on a cell to his loved one
on the left, and all
while riding a skateboard widdershins…

<h2>Yellow bird and black</h2>
<pre>
Through an arc of hot blossomy wind
in June, a yellow bird high
in the flowering pink tree
breathing outside my bedroom window

tilted his head and hopped up and
down, his round eye on me as if
to say, ‘How strange this wingless creature!’
through glass at this high altitude
between brain hemispheres.

Past noon, down the summer road
a man on his arid patch in an angry shove
swivelled the hose from dying grass to
rusted evergreen, which made me look up
at what he was dousing with his ill humour
for its being black and saying caw 

and all that. And I reflexed, ‘Don’t
do that! You’ll hurt the bird!’ The crow
flying to the north, shadowed
side of the house-high tree, sable feathers drenched
so he could hardly fly as the man pursued
with water pressure’s punishing fire –
I was afraid of the man’s anger

so left him to the black one (I’m sorry to say)
but hoped in my dreams the bird would remember
the man (as a corvus will) and come out some night
when he was taking out his garbage to peck out
his eyes in his innermost nightmare.

I mean, wasn’t the crow able? His satin feathers sleek
and strong? But the man was large, his arms boastfully
tattooed in self-pride. Swarthy and sleek and native
to these parts, couldn’t a crow jack o’spades
just fly away? But the man firmly believed
the black bird was evil, and I dared not

look back. Next day a flattened replica
of the bird on the pavement, its beak’s raw cry of injustice
embroidered bloodily on that pavement
heard through silent corners of the day, though
I tried in my mind to hold onto the yellow bird’s song
so winsome and sunny out my second-storey window
to brighten the crow shadows falling so jaggedly 
around my inability to sleep.
