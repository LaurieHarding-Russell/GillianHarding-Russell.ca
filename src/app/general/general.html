    <h2>A crow, raggedly, driven off course</h2>
    <pre>    
fighting the wind that broke the forearm of a poplar
(smaller birds holding onto elbow twigs in green lace
of cedar where they sipped the warmer air, the mauve 
of their dreams for brighter weather), and so as we walked 
around the dusky lake I noted the geese on the bank, their heads 
turned pragmatically into their feather backs close to the ground 

riding the present turning into whatever would be…
the tumult of our conversation against the unpredictable wind
became a struggle, a word awry, mine or yours – I cannot remember
who started it – catapulting like a dislodged twig 	that hit you

accidentally in the face, and I discovered we were each 
listening to our own mind’s thoughts set on their course by what 
had come before to make us what we were, and so we arrived 
sadly at the car, damaged by the mad direction 
the eddy our conversation had taken in the wind.

    description="In Another Air is a collection of poems about the north that I wrote after visiting my daughter in Yellowknife over a period of four years. By the title, I suggest a world removed from our own ‘in another latitude’ or ‘historical time frame’ or ‘aeon.’ Here the sense of a reality removed from our own may also be captured by the metaphor of a musical air. From poems about Franklin’s second expedition down the Coppermine River (inspired by the main drag in Yellowknife being called “Franklin’s Ave”) to modern day Yellowknife with a Diamond Centre and to a larger north with a complex archaeological past, the poems attempt to capture a kaleidoscopic vision of a changing north.">
        <h2>Raven at -40</h2>

<pre>
high on a street lamp
fans shadow wings 
to draw the ghost of sun

on the black of his back
setting the light sensor off.
What a nifty trick

(as a simple wit)
to get the device lit
and as a measure for
pleasure’s warmth
in the shade of the grey
ice midday.
