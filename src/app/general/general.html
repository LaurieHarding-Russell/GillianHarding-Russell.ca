<h2>In memory of three artists who died in one week</h2>
<pre>
(Patrick Lane, Joe Rosenblatt, Joe Fafard) 

Three colourful leaves dropped
into the stream of things

the water slick on their bright backs
as they came alive like fishes

under a film of water
and of our attention

but later they sank into the silt 
at the bottom of the everyday

only resurfacing at moments
like meteors in the dark

whose scintillating flash startled 
even themselves

until a sudden long pause
and sedimentary death

when a century or two later
a pebble skipped a thought

leaving a dent in the water
where widening circles 

closed over the smoothness 
underneath the opaque mirror 

weren’t those stars staring back 
behind the watery curtain of time

unique and motley, with the ordinary 
brilliance of mortals like ourselves?

    extraordinary energy and vision.

<h2>Raven at -40</h2>

<pre>
high on a street lamp
fans shadow wings 
to draw the ghost of sun

on the black of his back
setting the light sensor off.
What a nifty trick

(as a simple wit)
to get the device lit
and as a measure for
pleasure’s warmth
in the shade of the grey
ice midday.

<h2>Up Tin Can Hill</h2>
<pre>
    

Nothing like A. Y. Jackson’s painting 
with wild ochres and greens and magenta
the meadow lies before us and is frosted in snow. 
Rat Lake, that doesn’t have rats, but 
instead muskrats, deceives. The brushy tails 
with fluffy spores might be rat tails 

or horsetails according to the guidebook. 
Horsetails that once grew tall as trees 
chomped by immense lumbering creatures
between glacial ages that pushed 
the rocks at angles to ourselves.

At the height of the promontory that juts
over Great Slave, an icy wind
burns our faces in March, and I am
aware of the drop, avert
my eyes from vertigo
to a human contraption
to the right of where we stand
with claptrap dangling 
plastic and metal parts	
built for what purpose? Creaking 
in the sharp wind
that frosts our voices

and this wonder, like the obsolete 
mining apparatus, rusted and antique, 
discarded between the twiggy trees
might one day be considered 
trace human fossils – ichnotaxa.

On the white expanse of lake below us, skidoo tracks
smudge a fox’s neat footprints
and a ptarmigan’s zippered walk
along the shoreline between rocks.
I imagine I hear a skidoo’s
animal-like screech and huffing start
between thoughts.

Going back down the trail, a raven weaves
dark words and you tell me there were wolverines 
in this vicinity a few winters ago. Why am I both excited    
that they once coloured the trail with danger and
relieved they are no longer likely to be seen?
I mean to be seen at all
around here?
